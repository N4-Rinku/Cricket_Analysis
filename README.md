# IPL Data Analysis 📊🏏

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of the Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset to extract meaningful insights about teams, players, matches, and performance trends using **Python and data analytics techniques**.

The analysis helps understand:
- Team performance over seasons  
- Player statistics and consistency  
- Toss impact and match outcomes  
- Venue-based performance trends

## 📊 Key Analysis & Insights
- Match wins by teams across seasons
- Toss decision impact on match results
- Top run scorers and wicket takers
- Venue-wise match statistics
- Winning trends while batting first vs chasing


I worked on an end-to-end IPL data analysis project using Python and Pandas.

The goal was to identify factors influencing match outcomes such as toss decisions, venue impact, and batting order. I started by cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, handled missing values, and standardized columns.

I performed exploratory data analysis using visualizations like bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps to uncover trends. One key insight was that teams chasing had a significantly higher win percentage, especially at high-scoring venues.

I also defined KPIs such as toss win conversion rate and team-wise win percentage to make the analysis business-oriented.

This project helped me strengthen my analytical thinking, storytelling with data, and Python-based analytics workflow.
